This project comprises a little chatroom application I built using Socket IO, Node JS, and React. It allows you to choose a username, create a room, chat in it, see if other people are typing in it,
and view a "friends list" of people online (and what room they're in).

This app is not flawless, but was mostly built to learn and develop my skills with these frameworks. This app also certifies as a PWA and meets Lighthouse dev standards.

You can build and run it locally by doing the following:

- in server directory, `npm install`
- in server directory, `node server` to start server
- in client directory, `npm install`
- in client directory, `npm start`
- point one or more browser tabs at localhost:3000 (bear in mind the app was developed for mobile exclusively so the desktop viewport UX is sub-par)

Alternatively, it's currently (as of 2022/11/17) hosted up on Heroku at https://gordonreaman-chatapp.herokuapp.com/. However, since Heroku and every other cloud provider seem to be culling their free
tiers with extreme prejudice, it probably won't be live forever.

Give me a shout if you want to chat on my funny app, or for any other reason. It's not exactly IRC but that's not the point :)
